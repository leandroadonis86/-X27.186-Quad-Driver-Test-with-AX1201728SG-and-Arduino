# -X27.186-Quad-Driver-Test-with-AX1201728SG-and-Arduino
Small and basic .ino file for testing X27.186 Quad Driver Test with AX1201728SG Driver Controler using Arduino Uno. This was inspired from another project https://github.com/clearwater/SwitecX25/tree/X12 but I did myself this code just to have the base to operate with it.
